      This eclipse plugin provides an indexing infrastructure for other plugins based on the apache lucene search engine.

It works by adding an IncrementalProjectBuilder to projects with the nature of bundles implementing the com.dubture.indexing.core.buildParticipant extension point.

The implementing extension point will receive an IResource during the build and can then access an IndexingRequestor which can be used to store ReferenceInformation into a lucene index.

Using the SearchEngine utility class, this index can be queried later on.

For an example implementation of the extension point, see the Composer Eclipse Plugin.

The plugin is still alpha and its API will most likely change.
